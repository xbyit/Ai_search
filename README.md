#Overview

Ai_search leverages Flask blueprints to provide a modular backend that supports two primary search functions:

Document Search: Retrieves and processes document search results.

Video Search: Retrieves and processes video search results.


Both endpoints combine results from the external search engine (via duckduckgo-search) with AI enhancements for a more accurate and relevant response.


---

#Features

AI-Enhanced Search: Combines traditional search results with AI processing.

Modular Architecture: Easily extensible using Flask blueprints.

Dual Search Functionality: Separate endpoints for document and video searches.

External API Integration: Utilizes duckduckgo-search for querying external data sources.



---

#Tech Stack

Backend Framework: Flask

HTTP Client: requests

Search Engine: duckduckgo-search

Programming Language: Python 3.x



---

#Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/xbyit/Ai_search.git
cd Ai_search


2. Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt includes:

Flask==3.0.0
requests==2.31.0
duckduckgo-search==4.3




---

#Configuration

Before running the application, update your configuration settings in config.py:

DEBUG: Set to True for development, False for production.

SEARCH_API_URL: URL of the external search API.

AI_API_URL: URL of the AI processing service.



---

#Usage

Start the application by running:

python app.py

The server will start on http://0.0.0.0:5000.

#API Endpoints

Document Search

Endpoint: /api/search/Document

Method: POST

Description: Accepts a JSON payload with a query string to fetch and enhance document search results.

Request Example:

{
  "query": "example search term"
}

Response Example:

{
  "resulte": "AI processed search result"
}


Video Search

Endpoint: /api/search/video

Method: POST

Description: Accepts a JSON payload with a query string to fetch and enhance video search results.

Request Example:

{
  "query": "example video search term"
}

Response Example:

{
  "resulte": "AI processed search result"
}

This README provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the Ai_search project, mirroring the professional style seen in the User-Auth-Backend repository.


Modular Design: Built using Flask blueprints and service layers for ease of maintenance and extensibility.


Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Internet connection for API calls


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/xbyit/Ai_search.git
cd Ai_search


2. Install required dependencies:

If a requirements.txt file is available, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Otherwise, ensure that at minimum Flask is installed:

pip install Flask



Configuration

The application settings are managed in the config.py file. Update the configuration values as needed:

DEBUG: Set to True for development or False for production.

SEARCH_API_URL: URL endpoint for the external search API.

AI_API_URL: URL endpoint for the AI processing service.


Refer to config.py for the current configuration.

Running the Application

Run the application using the following command:

python app.py

The server will start on http://0.0.0.0:5000.

API Endpoints

Document Search

Endpoint: /api/search/Document

Method: POST

Description: Submits a search query to fetch document-related results. The query is processed via the external search API and refined using an AI service.

Request Payload Example:

{
  "query": "your search term"
}

Response Example:

{
  "resulte": "AI processed response based on search results"
}


Video Search

Endpoint: /api/search/video

Method: POST

Description: Submits a search query to fetch video-related results. Similar to document search, results are enhanced using the AI service.

Request Payload Example:

{
  "query": "your video search term"
}

Response Example:

{
  "resulte": "AI processed response based on video search results"
}


Refer to api_routes.py for detailed endpoint implementation.
